# Code On

## Description

My houseplant and I were working on a biology assignment together. Yes, my houseplant. Don't question it. Anyways, she ended up giving me a new cipher to use in my next project! So I'm giving it to my biology friends to see if they can solve it. They are, after all, studying DNA and mRNA right now.

AUGCAAGGUCUCUUGACCCAGUGGAUACUAAAUGCCUGGAAGGUAGCAUACUAG

Key: 6, 3, 4, 3, 1, 9, 8, 3, 3, 2, 7, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1

### Hint

Make sure to encase the plaintext with rtcp{} Spaces are represented by a underscore, (_)

## Solution

The title is subjective Code On to Codon (DNA or mRNA)

### Codon

AUG CAA GGU CUC UUG ACC CAG UGG AUA CUA AAU GCC UGG AAG GUA GCA UAC UAG

### Index of Amino Acids

01 - CAA - Glutamine <br />
02 - GGU - Glycine <br />
03 - CUC - Leucine <br />
04 - UUG - Leucine <br />
05 - ACC - Threonine <br />
06 - CAG - Glutamine <br />
07 - UGG - Tryptophan <br />
08 - AUA - Isoleucine <br />
09 - CUA - Leucine <br />
10 - AAU - Asparagine <br />
11 - GCC - Alanine <br />
12 - UGG - Tryptophan <br />
13 - AAG - Lysine <br />
14 - GUA - Valine <br />
15 - GCA - Alanine <br />
16 - UAC - Tyrosine <br />
